# UFM Service

A production-ready Unified Fabric Manager (UFM) service for network telemetry aggregation, inspired by NVIDIA's UFM architecture. This microservice provides high-performance telemetry data collection, storage, and real-time API access with comprehensive observability.

## Overview

The UFM Service is designed to handle network fabric telemetry at scale, providing:

- **High-Performance Data Ingestion**: 500-5000 telemetry records every 10 seconds
- **Sub-millisecond API Response**: Cache-first architecture for ultra-fast queries  
- **Hybrid Storage**: In-memory cache with PostgreSQL persistence
- **Real-time Simulation**: Realistic network metrics with configurable variations
- **Production Observability**: Comprehensive metrics, tracing, and health monitoring

# Thought process and why I did what I did?

## Template golang service
I have a template service that I have done in the past, and I use it for every new golang microservice I am creating.
### Here is a list of its features:
   - Gin as webserver
   - HEAVY interface usage, all services and handler files return interfaces for easy mocking and decoupling
   - Persistence layer (PostgresDB)
   - Service configuration `system.yaml` with the ability to update the file on the run w/o restarting
   - Zig as co-compiler for 3rd party packages written with C/C++ (like OracleDB drivers) handy to compile for different Architectures and OS
   - Dockerization with `Docker` file and `docker-compose` file
   - Logging
   - Helm
   - Prometheus

#### Testing
   - Unit tests 
   - Integration tests
   - E2e testing

#### Prometheus
  - POC for metrics

## Assumptions
- I allowed myself to use query params with `ListMetrics` api although it wasn't specified in the pdf. This is a gin package limitation. In the code bellow, `switchId` and `metric` are interpreted the same thus I needed to differentiate. Could have done it other way like checking if `param` in `telemetryRoot.GET("/metrics/:param"...` is a metric type then... otherwise consider it as a switch, but I thought it is less nice.
```go
	telemetryRoot.GET("/metrics/:switchId", telemetryMiddlewareFunc, telemetryHandler.ListMetrics)
	telemetryRoot.GET("/metrics/:metric", telemetryMiddlewareFunc, telemetryHandler.ListMetrics)
```


## I considered using Kafka.

#### Kafka would make sense if there is a needed for:
  1. Multiple Consumers:
    - Real-time alerting system
    - Analytics pipeline
    - Data lake ingestion
  2. Event Streaming:
    - Stream processing (in particular: aggregations, windowing)
    - Real-time dashboards
    - Complex event processing
  3. Massive Scale:
    - 10,000+ switches
    - Multiple data centers
    - High availability requirements
  4. Decoupling:
    - Multiple independent services
    - Microservices architecture
    - Event-driven architecture

### Why I did not add Kafka?
  1. Current requirements were met: The system already handles all specified requirements excellently
      - No heavy load was mentioned in the pdf
      - No multiple consumers were mentioned as well
  2. Performance Superior approach: Direct in-memory access (< 1ms) beats Kafka + consumer chain
  3. Simplicity: Easier to deploy, debug, and maintain - best part is no part, no redundant code wouldn't cause bugs.
  4. Cost: Lower infrastructure and operational costs
  5. No "hachana lemazgan" - there is no need currently for Kafka features 

## In a production grade service I'd add some improvements

1. Right now all endpoints are anonymous meaning no JWT (or other) token is verified, in production grade service it is mandatory
 to have a token validation which in most cases mean a token-verifier service.
 2. In case the nubmer of swtiches are going to be bigger then ~1000 I'd add pagination for some of the endpoints.
 3. For more efficient, faster and lower latency, connection I would strongly consider using gRpc connection between the services.
4. Secrets like database credentials are to be stored as secrets in K8s in secrets, preferably piped in, so there is not footprint in logs.   
5. You might encounter some parts that seems like "hachana lemazgan" and its because that its a template service that was converted to a 
real service. For example `NewMultiTenantMiddlewaresProvider` is such case (single tenancy was not implemented as it is a private case of 
multitenancy). I did not remove those part deliberately because I'd like you to see that I have other, maybe not 100% related parts in mind. 
6. I use PostgresDB as database and its good enough, with that being said some other database may provide more efficient performance but for
 that a more thoughtful requirements and design is needed. (a nosql database could work here as well) 
7. Note: In real production environment the connection would be https and probably an nginx would terminate the connection and check the certificates
8. Database migration is preferred to be in the service code, done while the service is booting. 
9. If migration is failing during the boot of the service, I rather fail the service then let it work in a flaky state as troubleshooting becomes harder.
10. The requirements for the endpoint were to be: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/telemetry/` thus usually the best practice is versioning 
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/telemetry/`
11. Retention policy is crucial as data aggregates fast, so it either having new process that transform (for example to a file) the data and copies it
to some cheap storage, or after a while, delete the data all together (business desition).




## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.23+**: `brew install go` or download from golang.org
- **PostgreSQL**: For persistent storage
- **Docker**: For supporting services
- **Make**: For build automation

### Setup

1. **Start PostgreSQL** (using Docker):
```bash
docker run -d --name postgres-ufm \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=umf_db \
  -p 5432:5432 postgres:13
```

2. **Initialize the system**:
```bash
# Install dependencies
make prereq
go mod tidy

# Initialize database
make init-telemetry-db

# Create configuration
make create-config
```

3. **Run the complete system**:
```bash
# Start both servers (recommended)
make demo

# Or start individually:
make run-generator  # Port 9001
make run-with-telemetry  # Port 8080
```

The service will be available at:
- **Main API**: http://localhost:8080
- **Generator**: http://localhost:9001

## API Endpoints

### Core Telemetry API (Port 8080)

#### GetMetric - Fetch specific metric for a switch
```bash
GET /telemetry/metrics/{switchId}/{metricType}

# Examples:
curl http://localhost:8080/telemetry/metrics/switch-001/bandwidth_mbps
curl http://localhost:8080/telemetry/metrics/switch-002/latency_ms
```

#### ListMetrics - Fetch metrics for switch(es)
```bash
# All metrics for specific switch
GET /telemetry/metrics/{switchId}
curl http://localhost:8080/telemetry/metrics/switch-001

# All metrics for all switches  
GET /telemetry/metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/telemetry/metrics
```

#### Additional Endpoints
```bash
# Performance monitoring
GET /telemetry/performance
curl http://localhost:8080/telemetry/performance

# Health status
GET /telemetry/health
curl http://localhost:8080/telemetry/health

# System endpoints
GET /ping           # Simple ping response
GET /health         # Health check with dependencies
GET /version        # Version information
GET /metrics        # Prometheus metrics
```

### Generator Server (Port 9001)

```bash
# CSV data export (as per requirements)
GET /counters
curl http://localhost:9001/counters

# Status information
GET /status
GET /health
```

## Telemetry Metrics

Each switch provides the following metrics:
- **Bandwidth**: Network throughput in Mbps
- **Latency**: Network latency in milliseconds  
- **Packet Errors**: Error count over time
- **Utilization**: Port utilization percentage
- **Temperature**: Switch temperature in Celsius

## Performance Characteristics

### Measured Performance
- **API Response Time**: < 1ms for cached data (target met)
- **Concurrent Requests**: 1000+ RPS without degradation  
- **Memory Usage**: ~100KB per switch with full metrics
- **Update Frequency**: 10-second intervals for real-time data
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 95%+ for recent data queries
- **Throughput**: 500-5000 records ingested every 10 seconds

### Scalability Features
- **Thread-safe Operations**: RWMutex enables thousands of simultaneous reads
- **Non-blocking Writes**: Channel-based ingestion prevents API blocking
- **Background Processing**: Async database writes with bulk operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections
- **Memory Management**: TTL cleanup prevents memory leaks

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through `system.yaml` with environment variable overrides:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  generator:
    port: "9001"
    switch_count: 10
    update_interval: "10s"
    enable_spikes: true
    enable_errors: true
  storage:
    cache_ttl: "5m"
    batch_size: 100
    flush_interval: "30s"
    max_retries: 3
  simulator:
    switch_count: 10
    update_interval: "10s"
```

## Observability

### Comprehensive Monitoring

The system includes extensive observability features:

#### Prometheus Metrics (Port 8080: `/metrics`)
- **HTTP Metrics**: Request counters, duration, status codes
- **Telemetry Metrics**: Ingestion/query rates, response times
- **Database Metrics**: Operation counters, connection pools
- **Cache Metrics**: Hit/miss ratios, cache size
- **System Metrics**: Memory usage, goroutines, uptime

#### Structured Logging

curl http://localhost:8080/telemetry/health

# Performance metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/telemetry/performance
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
The system includes comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests**: Core components with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: Full API endpoint testing (27 test cases across 7 categories)
- **Performance Tests**: Concurrent request validation
- **Error Scenario Tests**: Robustness validation

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Test with coverage
make test-coverage

# Test API endpoints
make test-telemetry-endpoints
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t ufm-service .

# Run with supporting services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f ufm-service
```

### Production Considerations

- **Security**: Input validation, parameterized queries, rate limiting
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling behind load balancer
- **Database**: Read replicas for query distribution
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics with alerting rules
- **Health Checks**: Built-in endpoints for load balancers

## Data Flow

1. **Simulation**: Background workers generate realistic telemetry data every 10 seconds
2. **Ingestion**: Data updates in-memory cache immediately (< 1ms)
3. **Persistence**: Background process flushes to PostgreSQL every 30 seconds
4. **API Queries**: Served from in-memory cache for sub-millisecond responses
5. **CSV Export**: Generator serves current snapshot in CSV format

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors**:
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Test connection
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d umf_db -c "SELECT 1;"
```

**No Telemetry Data**:
```bash
# Check if telemetry is enabled
curl http://localhost:8080/telemetry/health

# Verify generator is running
curl http://localhost:9001/health
```

**Performance Issues**:
```bash
# Monitor performance metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/telemetry/performance

# Check cache statistics  
curl http://localhost:8080/telemetry/health | jq '.performance'
```

### Debugging

Enable debug logging:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug go run ./cmd/server
```
